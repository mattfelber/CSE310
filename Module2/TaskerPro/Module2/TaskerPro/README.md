# C# Inheritance and Extension Methods Demo

# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve my understanding of object-oriented programming principles. This project demonstrates my exploration of inheritance and extension methods in C#, two powerful features that help create more maintainable and extensible code.

I've created a simple but effective demonstration using an animal hierarchy to show how inheritance works in C#. The project includes an abstract `Animal` class that serves as a base template, with `Dog` and `Cat` classes inheriting from it. This demonstrates how to create a flexible and reusable code structure.

The purpose of this software is to showcase how inheritance and extension methods can be used to:
- Create a common interface for related classes
- Share code between classes
- Add new functionality to existing classes without modifying them
- Implement polymorphic behavior

# Development Environment

I developed this software using:
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 9.0
- Blazor Server for the web interface
- Bootstrap for styling

The project uses C# as the primary programming language, with the following key features demonstrated:
- Abstract classes
- Inheritance
- Extension methods
- Polymorphism
- String interpolation
- Nullable reference types

# Future Work


- Add Dabase support for persistence
- Create a more sophisticated UI with animations
- Add remaining CRUD methods
